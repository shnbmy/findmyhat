javascript web assessment

sorry I couldn't finish the assesment again. im still trying to fully understand the concepts & figuring out how to apply them 🙏🏽

What did you like about this project?

 - there was help to get a headstart 
i was able to figure out a bit on how it functions 
and which concepts to read on & understand better


What did you struggle with in this project?

 - getting the game started & figuring out how to move my the player
 
 
What would make your experience with this assessment better?

 - the assesment used concepts like 2D Array that was fairly new (only learned this week) 
  hence i felt i didn't have much time to digest the information (as it takes me longer to fully understand concepts)
  making me struggle quite a bit doing the assesement
